in News section add: 
07/2025: Shipped an ultra-fast (~1s) diffusion-based removal model in Photoshop, delivering state-of-the-art production-level quality with virtually no insertion artifacts.
08/2025: Extended the ultra-fast (~1s) diffusion-based removal model to Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw, with full compatibility and high fidelity on RAW images.
10/2025: Shipped an upgraded, ultra–high-quality diffusion-based removal model in Photoshop, supporting native 2K-resolution generation and significantly improved visual realism.

add to News section: 
04/2023: My PhD research paper “Guided Patch” (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03552) was productized in Photoshop (add icon). It introduced the first hybrid deep-learning and patch-synthesis method that can generate images at unlimited ultra-high resolution.
02/2024: My Phd research papers "Perceptual Artifacts Localization V1/V2" (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03357, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05590) were was productized and integrated in Photoshop Remove Tool (add icon).
